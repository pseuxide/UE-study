# UE4.26Memo

Just me trying to understand Unreal Engine by writing code and compare the methodology with the data lying on the memory.

All credit goes to the interesting blog post in [shh0ya Security Lab](https://shhoya.github.io/ue_dumper.html) because I firstly read it to get the outline of it. Thanks for the greate contents.

Code is quite messy I was kinda brain storming while coding so my thinking processes are scattered around the code. Basically identical to the one introduced in the blog post tho.
