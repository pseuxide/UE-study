# UE4.26Memo

Just me trying to understand Unreal Engine.

All credit goes the interesting blog post by [shh0ya Security Lab](https://shhoya.github.io/ue_dumper.html) because I firstly read it to get the outline of it. Thanks for the greate content.

Code is quite messy I was kinda brain storming while coding so my thinking processes are scattered around the code.
